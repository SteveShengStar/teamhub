# TeamHub Project

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/waterloop/teamhub/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/waterloop/teamhub/actions)

## Installation

Clone from GitHub with:
```git clone https://www.github.com/waterloop/teamhub.git```

Navigate to `/backend/data/config.template.json`.
Make a copy and rename it to `config.json`.
Ask Michael Pu (@mchlp) for the database url.

Follow the instructions listed under Setting Up Development Environment

## Setting up Development Environment

Here are the steps to run locally:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Copy the contents of `/backend/data/config.template.json` into `/backend/data/config.json`
3. Go to the root directory and run `docker build ./docker -t teamhub`
4. To start the server, simply go to the root directory and run `docker-compose up -d`
5. To run a command in the docker container, for example `npm run test`, run `docker exec -it teamhub_nodejs /bin/sh`, which will open up a shell into the container and then you can run whichever commands you wish. To exit out of the container, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
6. To stop the docker containers, run `docker-compose stop`


To run tests locally, use the command `npm run test` **when you are in a shell inside `teamhub_nodejs` the docker container** to ensure there were no breaking changes (see step 5 above). If you are not inside the `teamhub_nodejs` the docker container, it will not connect to the database.

### Troubleshooting

* To use the MongoDB Compass desktop app, use `localhost` as the hostname and the default port 27017.

* If the DB did not load successfully from the dump and is empty, run `docker-compose rm` and then restart the server with `docker-compose up`.

## Contributing

1. Take a look under [Issues](https://github.com/waterloop/teamhub/issues) for ones you want to work on.
2. Assign yourself to the issue to let others know you are working on it.
3. Create a new branch and work on the issue on that branch.
4. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/waterloop/teamhub/pulls) for merging the new branch (this should be done when you start working on the issue) so that others may see your progress
5. Add the `wip` label to the Pull Request as well as `[WIP]` to the title of the Pull Request.
6. Once you are finished, remove the `wip` label and `[WIP]` from the title of the Pull Request, add the `ready-to-merge` label to your Pull Request, and add at least one reviewer.
7. Check up on your Pull Request and respond to any comments/questions
8. Once your Pull Request has been reviewed and approved, you may merge it with `staging` if it has not been done so already by the reviewer. When merging a pull request, use the `Create a merge commit` option.
9. After testing, the `staging` branch will then be merged with `master` and deployed to production by site maintainers.

## Technologies used

* Based on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) framework (Server-Side Rendered React).
* [Typescript](www.typescriptlang.org) setup (not being used at the moment)
* Front-End
  * [React](https://reactjs.org)
  * Design System uses [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com)
  * State management will use [Redux](https://redux.js.org) (and possibly [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) for asynchronous redux).
* Back-end
  * RESTful API created using ([ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com)? serving NextJS?)
  * MongoDB for database
  * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
