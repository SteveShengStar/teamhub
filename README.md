## Setting up Development Environment
Here are the steps to run locally:
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Copy the contents of `/backend/data/config.template.json` into `/backend/data/config.json`
3. Go to the root directory and run `docker build ./docker -t teamhub`
4. To start the server, simply go to the root directory and run `docker-compose up`
## Contributing
1. Take a look under [Issues](https://github.com/waterloop/teamhub/issues) for ones you want to work on.
2. Assign yourself to the issue to let others know you are working on it.
3. Create a new branch and work on the issue on that branch.
4. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/waterloop/teamhub/pulls) for merging the new branch (this should be done when you start working on the issue) so that others may see your progress
5. Add the `wip` label to the Pull Request as well as `[WIP]` to the title of the Pull Request.
6. Once you are finished, remove the `wip` label and `[WIP]` from the title of the Pull Request, add the `ready-to-merge` label to your Pull Request, and add at least one reviewer.
5. Check up on your Pull Request and respond to any comments/questions
6. Once your Pull Request has been reviewed and approved, you may merge it with `master` if it has not been done so already by the reviewer. When merging a pull request, use the `Create a merge commit` option.

## Installation

Clone from GitHub with: 
```git clone https://www.github.com/waterloop/teamhub.git```

Make a copy and rename it to `config.json`.
Ask Michael Pu for the database url.

`circleci config process .circleci/config.yml > process.yml`

Start docker
Run: ` circleci local execute -c process.yml`



(Navigate to repository then)
```npm install```

Build project
```npm run build```

Run server (development)
```npm run dev```
